# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

For this course, I had to implement commonly used data structures. These data structures consisted of a binary search tree, vector, linked list, and hash table. I was asked to implement sort, search, add, remove, and print for each of these data structures. In project two, the problem was to store and print a course schedule that included the prerequisites. I was asked to select the appropriate data structure based on the given problem and perform the functionality listed above to output the desired result.

# How did you approach the problem? 

I approached the problem by determining which data structure would most optimally solve the algorithm. Based on my analysis of the run-time and memory required for each data structure in project one, I chose a vector that would be most effective. Data structures are important to understand because they each have their pros and cons for different use cases. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I was able to overcome any roadblocks I encountered while going through the activities or project by revisiting course content on zyBooks. If I was still not fully understanding an aspect, I would seek further sources such as YouTube and Stackoverflow.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by valuing and analyzing each data structure before beginning the implementation to ensure the space and time complexity are efficient for the program. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by reinforcing industry-standard coding habits. I ensured my code was commented, easy to understand, utilized appropriate variable naming principles, and avoided using direct paths.
